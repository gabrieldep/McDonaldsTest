## Overview

Assuming that I have a restaurant with multiple POS (point-of-sale) instances sending orders that should be routed to specific
areas of a kitchen, I was tasked with writing a piece of software to do a Restaurant Order Routing.
It must comprise a HTTP Server with an endpoint to receive an Order and place it in a queue representing a destination kitchen area.
